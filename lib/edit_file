Now run:
```bash
flutter clean && flutter pub get
```

This solution:
1. Replaces the outdated charts_flutter with the modern fl_chart package
2. Provides a more visually appealing and customizable chart implementation
3. Restores intl to the latest version since we no longer have the version constraint
4. Maintains all the functionality of the original implementation but with better performance and maintainability

The new implementation includes:
- Responsive bar charts that adapt to the data
- Proper labeling for days, months, and years
- Smooth animations
- Better touch interaction
- Theme-aware styling
- Null safety support

Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation or help with anything else?
